ToDo Application (Python, Django, MySQL)

Description:
I recently developed a ToDo application using the Django framework, focusing on user authentication and comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by providing a simple and intuitive interface.

Key functionalities of the application include:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely, with session management and password encryption.
Task Management: Users can create new tasks, edit or update existing ones, and delete tasks once completed.
Pagination and Search: I implemented pagination to handle large task lists and added a search feature for users to quickly find specific tasks.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Python programming, Django development, and database management. It showcases my ability to integrate user authentication and build scalable, dynamic web applications with advanced functionalities like searching and pagination.
